This library consists of two python modules: xlrd3 and xlwt3

They are python 3.* clones of two packages used for reading and writing to MS 
excel files (respectively). The reason they have been included as a separate 
directory is so that users wont have to go scouring the internet for them, and 
wont have to download more packages to use it. 

I do not claim copyright to these sub-directories, nor does RailComm LLC. They 
utilize a BSD-License as well, and are merely included for usefulness and can 
be excluded from the download.
