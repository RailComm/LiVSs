LiVSs Installation requires Python and two packages for Microsoft Excel
File usage. Otherwise, LiVSs is fairly compact in its requirements.

Dependencies:
	Python 3.2:   http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.2/
	xlwt3:        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlwt3
	xlrd3:        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd3
	
  Note: Both xlwt3 and xlrd3 have been included in this repo under
  src/xlutils. They can be ignored if you have the packages already
  installed.
	
Optional Dependancies:
	CX_Freeze:    http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/
	
  Note: You only need CX_Freeze if you want an EXE of LiVSs to put on
  your system path. Otherwise you can ignore this dependency.
